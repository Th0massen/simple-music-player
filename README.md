# A simple music player
A simple music player, playing random songs from an array.

This is just a random hobby project, 
in order to add your own music, add the song to the folder called 'songs', 
open the radio.js code and add the new song to the array called music.

Make sure to write the filename correctly, and feel free to remove the sample songs added.
